Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts.<Br>

After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women across the world. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.<Br>

Substantial support for breast cancer awareness and research funding has helped created advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer survival rates have increased, and the number of deaths associated with this disease is steadily declining, largely due to factors such as earlier detection, a new personalized approach to treatment and a better understanding of the disease.<Br>

The data set that we have is a study done in 306 Patients with Breast cancer and thier survival post operation. <Br>

## Conclusions 

The Breast Cancer survival data was analysed and the following conlcusions are drawn from the data <br>

It was observed that 26% of the Patients in the data set did not survive after 5 years of operation<br>

Patients with Pos Axillary Nodes 0-7 have long survival chances, but Patients who have average 4 axillary nodes have short survival status.<br>

Patients between age 40-60 with Pos axillary node 0-10 have short survival chances.<br>

Patients between age 47-60 with Pos axillary node 0-3 have longer survival chances. <br>

As the age and Pos Axillary Nodes Increase the chances of survival  beyond 5 Years reduce for the patients<br>

## Insights
Pos Axillary Nodes provide an insight into the survival status of the Patients <br>

Early age detection can help catch the disease at early stage <br>

Mass Screenings should be done at age >30 for Women to detect the count of Pos Axillary Nodes <br>

Early Detection of Breast Cancer is the best way to fight against the disease <br>

More studies with parameters like Vegan/Non Veg ,History, smoking, alcohol consumption, genetic structure needs to be empanelled to understand the disease better and prevent prognosis <br>
